function rgb2cm(h)
% rgb2cm - Clean up colour mapping in patches to allow Painter's mode
%
% Painter's mode rendering is required for copying a figure to the
% clipboard as an EMF (vector format) or printing to vector-format files
% such as PDF and EPS. However, if the colours of any patches in your 
% figure are represented using CData and an RGB colour code, these will not
% show in the copied figure. You may also get a warning like:
% Warning: RGB color data not yet supported in Painter's mode 
%
% One solution is to change these specific patches to use an index into the
% colormap. That's what this script does. For each patch using RGB, it adds
% those colours to the colormap and changes the patch to use a colormap
% index.
