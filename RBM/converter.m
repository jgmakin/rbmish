% This program reads raw MNIST files available at
% http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
% and converts them to files in matlab format
% Before using this program you first need to download files:
% train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz
% t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz
% and gunzip them. You need to allocate some space for this.

% This program was originally written by Yee Whye Teh
